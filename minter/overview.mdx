# ðŸ”’ EVM Minter

The **EVM Minter** is the core bridging component that enables secure token transfers between EVM chains and the Internet Computer (ICP). It works by locking tokens on the EVM side and minting corresponding wrapped tokens on ICP.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Lock Tokens">
    Tokens are locked in a smart contract on the EVM chain
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validation">
    The transaction is validated using threshold ECDSA signing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mint Wrapped Tokens">
    Equivalent wrapped tokens are minted on the ICP chain
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transfer Complete">
    User receives wrapped tokens in their ICP wallet
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use Cases

### 1. Deposit (Lock â†’ Mint)

  <Card title="Native Tokens" icon="ethereum">
    Convert native tokens like ETH, BNB into wrapped versions (icETH, icBNB)
  </Card>
  <Card title="ERC20 Tokens" icon="coins">
    Convert ERC20 tokens like USDT, USDC into wrapped versions (icUSDT, icUSDC)  
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 2. Withdrawal (Burn â†’ Unlock)

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Burn Wrapped Tokens" icon="fire">
    Wrapped tokens (icETH, icBNB) are burned on ICP
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unlock Original Tokens" icon="unlock">
    Original tokens (ETH, BNB) are unlocked on the EVM chain
  </Card>

## Technical Details

### Smart Contract Architecture

- **Vault Contract**: Holds locked EVM tokens
- **Minter Canister**: Manages minting/burning of wrapped tokens
- **Helper Contract**: Facilitates transaction processing

### Token Standards

- **EVM Side**: ERC20/Native tokens
- **ICP Side**: ICRC-1/ICRC-2 compliant wrapped tokens

<Warning>
  Always verify contract addresses and canister IDs before initiating transfers. Use official Appic documentation and interfaces only.
